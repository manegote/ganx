# Spot Welder Controller for Battery Assembly

High-quality battery pack assembly requires reliable spot welding of nickel strips to cells. This controller provides the precision timing needed for consistent welds using a microwave transformer-based welder.

## Why Spot Welding?

Soldering directly to battery cells can damage them with excessive heat. Spot welding creates a mechanical and electrical connection without thermal stress, making it the preferred method for professional battery pack assembly.

## Controller Features

- Precise timing control (0.1ms resolution)
- Adjustable current via transformer taps
- Zero-crossing synchronization for consistent energy delivery
- Foot pedal operation for hands-free welding
- Visual and audible feedback
- Safety interlocks and emergency stop

## Safety Considerations

Microwave transformers output lethal voltages and currents. The controller incorporates multiple safety features:
- Optoisolated control circuits
- Emergency stop circuits
- Proper grounding and isolation
- Clear safety warnings and procedures
- Automatic timeout protection

## Weld Quality

Consistent, high-quality welds depend on:
- Proper electrode pressure
- Clean contact surfaces
- Correct timing for material thickness
- Consistent energy delivery

The controller addresses the timing and energy consistency, while proper technique handles the mechanical aspects.

## Performance Results

Testing on 0.1mm and 0.15mm nickel strips shows:
- Consistent weld nugget formation
- Joint strength exceeding strip tensile strength
- Minimal heat-affected zone
- No cell damage during welding process

This tool enables reliable, professional-quality battery pack assembly at a fraction of commercial welder cost.

## Temperature Control System

Precise temperature control is essential for proper reflow:
- K-type thermocouple with cold junction compensation
- PID control algorithm tuned for oven thermal mass
- Solid-state relay for element switching
- Safety cutoffs and alarm systems
- Profile programming capability

## Reflow Profiles

Different solder pastes require specific temperature profiles:
- Lead-free SAC305 (most common modern profile)
- Leaded 63/37 (for older or sensitive components)
- Low-temperature profiles for temperature-sensitive parts
- Custom profiles for specific paste formulations

## Safety Implementation

High-temperature operation requires robust safety systems:
- Multiple temperature monitoring points
- Thermal fuse backup protection
- Door interlock to prevent accidental opening
- Software and hardware temperature limits
- Smoke detection and ventilation

## Performance Validation

Testing with various board types confirms reliable operation:
- 0402 passives solder consistently
- Fine-pitch QFN packages achieve proper wetting
- Temperature uniformity within Â±5Â°C across chamber
- Repeatable profile execution cycle after cycle

This tool has revolutionized PCB prototyping capability, enabling complex designs that would be impossible to assemble by hand while maintaining professional quality standards.
