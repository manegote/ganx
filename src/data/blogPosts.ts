# Building a Custom Lithium Battery Pack Load Tester

When working with lithium-ion battery packs, proper storage is crucial for longevity. Packs should be stored at approximately 3.7V per cell (around 50% charge) to minimize degradation. However, commercially available load testers are either too expensive or lack the precision needed for this task.

## The Problem

Most consumer battery testers are designed for testing, not for precise discharge to storage voltage. Industrial load testers cost thousands of dollars and are overkill for small-scale operations. I needed something that could:

- Safely discharge packs to precise voltages
- Handle various pack configurations (6S, 7S, 10S, etc.)
- Monitor temperature during discharge
- Log discharge curves for analysis

## The Solution

I designed a microcontroller-based load tester using:

- Arduino Mega 2560 for control
- High-power MOSFETs for load switching
- Precision voltage dividers for monitoring
- Temperature sensors for safety
- LCD display for real-time feedback

## Circuit Design

The heart of the system is a current-controlled load using power MOSFETs. The Arduino continuously monitors pack voltage and adjusts the load to maintain a constant discharge current until the target voltage is reached.

Key safety features include:
- Overcurrent protection
- Thermal shutdown
- Emergency stop button
- Automatic cutoff at minimum safe voltage

## Results

The completed tester successfully discharges packs to within 0.1V of target voltage while maintaining detailed logs of the discharge process. This has significantly improved my pack storage procedures and extended battery life.

Next steps include adding Bluetooth connectivity for remote monitoring and a proper enclosure for field use.

# DIY Spot Welder Controller for Battery Pack Assembly

Building custom lithium battery packs requires joining cells with nickel strips, and spot welding is the preferred method. While commercial spot welders exist, they're expensive and often lack the precision needed for consistent welds.

## Why Build Your Own?

Commercial spot welders for battery work cost $500-2000+. A DIY solution using a microwave transformer can be built for under $100 while providing better control over weld parameters.

## Design Requirements

- Precise timing control (0.1ms resolution)
- Adjustable current via transformer taps
- Safety interlocks and emergency stop
- Foot pedal operation for hands-free welding
- Visual and audible feedback

## Circuit Implementation

The controller uses an Arduino Nano to generate precisely timed pulses that drive a high-current relay connected to the transformer primary. Key components:

- Zero-crossing detection for consistent timing
- Optoisolated relay drivers for safety
- Current monitoring via CT transformers
- LED indicators for status feedback

## Safety Considerations

Working with microwave transformers requires extreme caution:
- Proper grounding and isolation
- Emergency stop circuits
- Clear warning labels
- Never operate without safety gear

## Performance

The completed welder consistently produces high-quality welds on 0.1mm and 0.15mm nickel strips. Weld strength testing shows joints that are stronger than the strip material itself.

This tool has become essential for my battery pack assembly workflow, enabling reliable, repeatable welds every time.

# Converting a Toaster Oven into a SMD Reflow Oven

Surface-mount component soldering by hand becomes impractical for complex boards with fine-pitch components. A reflow oven enables professional-quality PCB assembly at home, and converting a toaster oven is surprisingly straightforward.

## Choosing the Right Oven

Not all toaster ovens are suitable for conversion. Key requirements:
- Large enough chamber for your boards
- Elements on top and bottom
- Good insulation
- Manual controls (not electronic)

I selected a mid-size convection oven with exposed heating elements for easy modification.

## Temperature Control System

The core of any reflow oven is precise temperature control. My system uses:

- K-type thermocouple for temperature sensing
- MAX31855 amplifier for cold junction compensation
- Arduino for PID control logic
- Solid-state relay for element switching
- Safety cutoffs and alarms

## PID Tuning Process

Getting the temperature profile right requires careful PID tuning. The process involves:
1. Initial parameter estimation
2. Step response testing
3. Iterative tuning for optimal response
4. Profile validation with test boards

## Reflow Profiles

Different solder pastes require different temperature profiles. I've programmed several standard profiles:
- Lead-free SAC305 (most common)
- Leaded 63/37 (for older components)
- Low-temperature profiles for sensitive parts

## Safety Features

Reflow ovens operate at high temperatures and require robust safety systems:
- Thermal fuses as ultimate backup
- Software temperature limits
- Door interlock switches
- Smoke detection and ventilation

## Results

The converted oven consistently produces professional-quality solder joints on everything from 0402 passives to fine-pitch QFN packages. Total conversion cost was under $150 vs $1500+ for commercial units.

This tool has revolutionized my PCB prototyping workflow, enabling complex designs that would be impossible to assemble by hand.
