- Voltage/capacity combinations
- Temperature ranges
- Discharge characteristics
- Integration requirements

Commercial packs often don't meet these needs, creating opportunity for custom solutions.

## Required Infrastructure

To build this business successfully, several supporting projects are required:
1. Load tester for pack validation and storage prep
2. Spot welder for reliable assembly
3. Modular case system for different form factors
4. Testing and validation procedures
5. Quality control systems

## Business Model

- Custom design consultation
- Prototype development
- Small batch manufacturing
- Testing and validation services
- Maintenance and repair services

## Current Status

Infrastructure projects are underway. The load tester and spot welder are complete, with the case system in development. Initial customer inquiries show strong demand for the service.

# Spot Welder Controller for Battery Assembly

High-quality battery pack assembly requires reliable spot welding of nickel strips to cells. This controller provides the precision timing needed for consistent welds using a microwave transformer-based welder.

## Why Spot Welding?

Soldering directly to battery cells can damage them with excessive heat. Spot welding creates a mechanical and electrical connection without thermal stress, making it the preferred method for professional battery pack assembly.

## Controller Features

- Precise timing control (0.1ms resolution)
- Adjustable current via transformer taps
- Zero-crossing synchronization for consistent energy delivery
- Foot pedal operation for hands-free welding
- Visual and audible feedback
- Safety interlocks and emergency stop

## Safety Considerations

Microwave transformers output lethal voltages and currents. The controller incorporates multiple safety features:
- Optoisolated control circuits
- Emergency stop circuits
- Proper grounding and isolation
- Clear safety warnings and procedures
- Automatic timeout protection

## Weld Quality

Consistent, high-quality welds depend on:
- Proper electrode pressure
- Clean contact surfaces
- Correct timing for material thickness
- Consistent energy delivery

The controller addresses the timing and energy consistency, while proper technique handles the mechanical aspects.

## Performance Results

Testing on 0.1mm and 0.15mm nickel strips shows:
- Consistent weld nugget formation
- Joint strength exceeding strip tensile strength
- Minimal heat-affected zone
- No cell damage during welding process

This tool enables reliable, professional-quality battery pack assembly at a fraction of commercial welder cost.

# SMD Reflow Oven Conversion

Hand-soldering surface-mount components becomes impractical for complex boards with fine-pitch packages. A reflow oven enables professional-quality PCB assembly at home, and converting a toaster oven is a cost-effective approach.

## Oven Selection

Critical factors for oven selection:
- Adequate chamber size for target boards
- Top and bottom heating elements
- Good insulation for temperature stability
- Manual controls (avoid electronic controls that interfere with modification)
- Reasonable element response time

## Temperature Control System

Precise temperature control is essential for proper reflow:
- K-type thermocouple with cold junction compensation
- PID control algorithm tuned for oven thermal mass
- Solid-state relay for element switching
- Safety cutoffs and alarm systems
- Profile programming capability

## Reflow Profiles

Different solder pastes require specific temperature profiles:
- Lead-free SAC305 (most common modern profile)
- Leaded 63/37 (for older or sensitive components)
- Low-temperature profiles for temperature-sensitive parts
- Custom profiles for specific paste formulations

## Safety Implementation

High-temperature operation requires robust safety systems:
- Multiple temperature monitoring points
- Thermal fuse backup protection
- Door interlock to prevent accidental opening
- Software and hardware temperature limits
- Smoke detection and ventilation

## Performance Validation

Testing with various board types confirms reliable operation:
- 0402 passives solder consistently
- Fine-pitch QFN packages achieve proper wetting
- Temperature uniformity within ±5°C across chamber
- Repeatable profile execution cycle after cycle

This tool has revolutionized PCB prototyping capability, enabling complex designs that would be impossible to assemble by hand while maintaining professional quality standards.
